### Open data API

#### Bugs and Requests
The purpose of this repository is to work as the public issue tracker for the Chancellery of the Riigikogu's [Open data API](https://aavik.riigikogu.ee/api/ems/v1/raml/ems-api-v1.html). If you've found a bug in the API, or have ideas on how we could improve it, please [create an issue](https://github.com/riigikogu-kantselei/api/issues). It's greatly appreciated.

We differentiate between *enhancement requests* and *feature requests* in that enhancement requests are improvement of existing features, while feature requests are requests for entirely new features.

##### Open issues
[Open bug tickets](https://github.com/riigikogu-kantselei/api/labels/bug) | [Open feature requests](https://github.com/riigikogu-kantselei/api/labels/feature%20request) | [Open enhancement requests](https://github.com/riigikogu-kantselei/api/labels/enhancement%20request)

**If you want to show your support for an existing feature request, please add a [thumbs up reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead of commenting  "_+1_".** This way the creator of the feature request doesn't get bombarded with notifications.

#### Other support
If you have ideas, bug reports, or any other type of technical feedback to the Chancellery of the Riigikogu that doesn't relate to the Open data API, please submit these to our [webmaster](mailto:webmaster@riigikogu.ee).
